# Automatic-Diagnosis-of-Heart-Diseases-Using-Artificial-Intelligence
  In 2020, physio net introduced a massive 12 lead dataset collected from various hospitals all over the world. Using this data set, we attempted to increase the accuracy achieved by the previous works by proposing an ensemble model based on various baseline residual neural network models to classify the 27 heart diseases. By
assigning weights to the predictions from the base models, our model achieved an accuracy of 94.57 percent beating the best-ranked model in the competition. We also used a novel approach of assigning weights to the labels in our project to deal with the data imbalance.
